# Permedia_Plugin


This package is a plugin written for Halliburton's Permedia software to calculate gas/oil/water/CO2 equilibrium following 'Thermodynamics of Hydrocarbon Reservoirs' by Abbas Firoozabadi. 

C++ SampleHandles are used to define the functions for the calculations. The diretives at the bottom of the file are the functions names needed for the Permedia API (separate files). 

This program successfully compiles with Visual Studio 2012, but we did have problems compiling with early versions.
